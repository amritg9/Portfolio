Dear Dr. Pinaki Ranjan Ray, 

I heard about your story from my Dad, who once volunteered in one of your eye camps In India. His
face always lit up in admiration when he proudly shared that he had witnessed you perform 50+
cataract operations within an hour. I always wondered whether this was even possible, until one
day I found a [Facebook site](https://www.facebook.com/PinakiRayEyeFoundation/videos/fondly-remembering-our-founder-one-of-the-most-eminent-and-notable-ophthalmologi/832077040874513/) stating that you performed 152,412 cataract operations over a service
career of 42 years. 

Even as I live in a country with far greater access to medicine, your innovation is extraordinary.
With limited tools, you were able to devise your own surgical techniques and successfully repeat
them in an extremely fast, effective, and safe manner to treat a large patient population - at
virtually no cost. Most of all, I hold deep respect for your choice of serving your home, and your
vision of bringing light one eye at a time. Your actions prompted me to recognize and work
towards solving health service inequities in my own community.

My recent clinical work with some EMT patients, fueled by my interest in medicine from childhood,
showed me a similar need for the underprivileged people in my area. The prevalence of chronic
alcoholism, smoking, obesity, and the lack of adequate healthcare among the low-income and
rural populations are a different face of the same issue you found in your country. I see your path
of selfless service as a key to solve this problem.

Just as you established a long eyecare standard with [Pinaki Roy Eye Foundation](https://www.facebook.com/PinakiRayEyeFoundation/), I share the same
belief and wish to change the status quo. I thank you for your exemplary work that has kindled
hope in the world, and strive to uphold your belief in Tamosoma Jyotirgamaya: bringing light from
darkness.

Sincerely,

Amrit Ghosh
