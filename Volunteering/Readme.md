#### Plano East Helping Hands Club (co-founder)
##### 2021 - Present
Aside from being a member of the National Honor Society chapter at my high school, I've taken a more active role in helping out in my community. 
I had noticed throughout the year that because of the COVID-19 pandemic, opportunities to volunteer in our community had stagnated. Seeing this, my friend and I started the Helping Hands club to reintroduce more group-led volunteering at our school. So far, we have coordinated 20+ hours of service with the [Texas Ramp Project](https://www.texasramps.org/) (an organization that replaces broken wheelchair ramps for the elderly), grown to 16 active members, and are currently working on expanding to host events at retirement homes and other medical facilities in our community. 
#### Hospice volunteering 
##### 2021 - Present
I started volunteering for Encompass Health Hospice around mid-2021. Talking to hospice patients, I find they need emotional support and enjoy their life. So, I decided to bring in choir singing to hospice patients and people living in assisted living facilities. I joined few Hospice groups (i,e Three Oaks Hospice and Medical city Hospice) to lead thr choir group singing as well as careing needs.  
#### Medical Volunteering training
##### 2022 - Present
I'm CPR certified and a member of the American Red Cross.I am currently taking Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) training. I wish to apply the skills I learn and apply them to make a difference for the larger community in need.
#### Music Production Club (founder)
##### 2022 - Present
Because of my passion for singing, I founded the Music Production Club at my school; as a group, we have arranged, performed, and recorded successfully numerous times.  Recently, we finished performing our rendition of "Mr. Blue Sky", and are working towards a series of summer sessions and performances. 

#### Other Volunteering 
##### 2018-2019
I joined Lion's Heart volunteering (lionsheartservices) to volunteer for many community efforts. One of the efforts that really connected me was Color a Smile that works to distribute artwork to put smile to people's faces. With my innate passion for creating artwork, I created 97 colored artwork for this organization.
