#### Plano East Helping Hands Club (co-founder)
##### 2021 - Present
Aside from being a member of the National Honor Society chapter at my high school, I've taken a more active role in helping out in my community. 
I had noticed throughout the year that because of the COVID-19 pandemic, opportunities to volunteer in our community had stagnated though there is enough willingness among the students to volunteer and reach out to the people in need. Seeing this, my friend and I started the Helping Hands club to reintroduce more group-led volunteering at our school. So far, we have coordinated 300+ man hours of service with the [Texas Ramp Project](https://www.texasramps.org/) (an organization that replaces broken wheelchair ramps for the elderly), grown to 16 active members, and are currently working on expanding to host events at retirement homes and other medical facilities in our community.

#### Hospice volunteering 
##### 2021 - Present
I started volunteering for Encompass Health Hospice around mid-2021. Talking to hospice patients, I find they need emotional support and enjoy their life. So, I decided to bring in choir singing to hospice patients and people living in assisted living facilities. I joined few Hospice groups (i,e Three Oaks Hospice and Medical city Hospice) to lead our choir group singing as well as careing needs along with a group of UTD (university of Texas at Dallas) pre-medical students. Unfortunately I cannot publish any photos of the work because of HIPPA compliance guidelines.  

#### Medical Volunteering training
##### 2022 - Present
I'm [CPR certified](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17h2OFe0JQm8_9fEMJm6i6qsTganMsD9g/view?usp=sharing) and a member of the American Red Cross.I am currently taking Emergency Medical Technician [(EMT)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vZnTuH9Fu6uN2nnD4Uqd8By6aMQXnQ9J/view?usp=sharing) training. I have performed 32 hours of [clinical services volunteering](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dbZ-xxkyDb1x5Q44XxRNaeH_ACIBiwAK/view?usp=share_link) under the supervision of an EMTS paramedic with real emergency patients. I am also a [Nationally certified emergency Technician](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OPGnwMYN4Jd6ps8HiPgtA5rJ9QzFPD9f/view?usp=share_link). I wish to apply the skills I learn and apply them to make a difference for the larger community in need.

#### Music Production Club (Founder)
##### 2022 - Present
Because of my passion for singing, I founded the Music Production Club at my school; as a group, we have arranged, performed, and recorded successfully numerous times.  Recently, we finished performing our rendition of ["Mr. Blue Sky"](https://youtu.be/PyHjsX8fWYA), and are working towards a series of summer sessions and performances. 

#### Other Volunteering 
##### 2018-2019
I joined Lion's Heart volunteering (lionsheartservices) to volunteer for many community efforts. One of the efforts that really connected me was Color a Smile that works to distribute artwork to put smile to people's faces. With my innate passion for creating artwork, I created 97 colored artwork for this organization. [Color a smile Letter](https://github.com/amritg9/Portfolio/blob/main/Volunteering/Ghosh%2C%20Amrit%20vl02.pdf). I also volunteered for Plano City Cleanup, [Plano Cares](https://www.plano.gov/969/Plano-CARES), Dallas ArtFest and [North Texas Food Bank](https://ntfb.org/) during Thanksgiving.
