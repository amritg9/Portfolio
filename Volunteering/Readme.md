#### Plano East Helping Hands Club (co-founder)
##### 2021 - Present
Aside from being a member of the National Honor Society chapter at my high school, I've taken a more active role in helping out in my community. 
I had noticed throughout the year that because of the COVID-19 pandemic, opportunities to volunteer in our community had stagnated. Seeing this, my friend and I started the Helping Hands club to reintroduce more group-led volunteering at our school. So far, we have coordinated 20+ hours of service with the [Texas Ramp Project](https://www.texasramps.org/) (an organization that replaces broken wheelchair ramps for the elderly), grown to 16 active members, and are currently working on expanding to host events at retirement homes and other medical facilities in our community. 
#### Music Production Club (founder)
##### 2022 - Present
Because of my passion for singing, I founded the Music Production Club at my school; as a group, we have arranged, performed, and recorded successfully numerous times.  Recently, we finished performing our rendition of "Mr. Blue Sky", and are working towards a series of summer sessions and performances.
