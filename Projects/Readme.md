#### Improve dense breast tissue cancer diagnosis with machine learning  
##### 2022 - Present
Using data science modeling techniques, I am working towards using clinical, image data and biometrics to implement an efficient diagnosis algorithm that can potentially save valuable time and effort in predicting dense tissue breast cancer detection. I am working under the supervision of a postdoctoral fellow researcher from Johns Hopkins University.

#### Medical Imaging analysis and applicability
##### 2022 - Present
I developed some interest in medical imaging and studying datasets used for various medical applications and diagnosis. So, I take up this project to research various datasets and their applicability areas in medical diagnosis and automated diagnosis areas. I am looking forward to consolidate all my research findings into a paper for the benefit of the medical research community.

##### 2021 - 2022
I performed research on hydroxyapatite and collagen in bone for their contribution to piezo and pyroelectricity, under the supervision of Mrs. Karen Compton. By studying the morphology of these two components, how their properties vary under different stress conditions, and their relation to each other, a clearer picture of the creation and role of electric properties in the bone can be established. This is an important area of research because it can bypass biomedical applications that use intrusive technology - such as pacemakers and - by using natural bioelectricity.[Article](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BIqV1P8yPyiMmM0HMqEkbWLrn4uGYmns/view?usp=sharing)

#### [AI Powered Chest Disease Detection and Classification](https://github.com/amritg9/Portfolio/blob/main/CourseraAIPoweredChestDisease.pdf)
##### 2022
I completed an AI-Powered Chest Detection and Classification using Data science tools like python and a pre-trained ResNet convolutional neural network model to detect chest disease using a binary classification technique in Coursera. I plan to train and develop myself further on this technology for future bioinformatics research projects.

#### Volunteer Opportunity App using Python Web scraping
##### 2021 
I completed a volunteer opportunity search app in python and used it successfully to register myself as a volunteer at our Teen Court. This is because the opportunity gets filled in within minutes after it opens on the web at a particular date and time.

#### Saving a baby infants life in a hot car with Arduino alarm
##### 2017 
This is a science project to develop a device that can save a baby’s life from dying when left in a hot car. This implements an alarm system with Arduino that uses a baby’s weight and the ambient temperature to produce a sound alarm, send a text message to a phone, and switch on the car emergency light.In this project, a piezoelectric weight sensor and a heat sensor is used as an input and sound alarm, a 2G mobile IoT enabled SIM and an electromagnet is used to produce sound and text alarm and activate the emergency light system in a car. In future I plan to pass signals directly from the prototype to the car OBD2 diagnostic port to directly enable auto emergency light. This requires in-depth study of the OBD2 codes and testing with different cars. I presented this for my school science project.
