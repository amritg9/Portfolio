## Neuroimaging Notes
### The Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) http://www.oasis-brains.org/
* OASIS-3 is a longitudinal neuroimaging, clinical, cognitive, and biomarker dataset for normal aging and Alzheimer’s Disease
  * <b>Longitudinal data analysis</b> - Neuroimaging data collected over a period of time (i,e in a time-series format). Each subject’s outcome/responses are observed or measured repeatedly, thereby allowing for the direct study of change over time or natural history.
  * <b>cross-sectional data analysis</b> - Neuroimaging data collected where subject responses are obtained at just one time-point
  * Best definition of a [<b>bio-marker</b>](https://www.news-medical.net/health/What-is-a-Biomarker.aspx) and also [<b>Bio-marker</b>](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/biomarker-qualification-program/what-are-biomarkers-and-why-are-they-important-transcript)
  * Biomarkers are characteristics of the body that you can measure. So your blood pressure is actually a biomarker. Biomarkers are very important to medicine in general. We’re all used to going to the doctor and getting all our test results, right, and even imaging — x-ray results or CAT scans — those are biomarkers that tell how the body’s doing, and they’re measurable.
* Dataset is freely available to the scientific community
* OASIS-3 data is collected from participants that include 609 cognitively normal adults and 489 individuals at various stages of cognitive decline ranging in age from 42-95yrs
* [<b>Accessing and download formats for OASIS data</b>](https://wiki.xnat.org/central/oasis-on-xnat-central-60981641.html)
* OASIS diagnostic (CDR and dementia diagnosis) can be found with other demographic data in “ADRC Clinical Data”.
### Openneuro (formerly Openfmri) - https://openneuro.org/search/modality/mri
* Data deposited in OpenfMRI can be used to address or validate many questions concerning the human brain structure and function
* Discoveries using this data not only help us understand how the human brain works, but also get us closer to understanding and curing mental illnesses
* OpenfMRI has also been listed as a recommended repository by some academic journals such as Nature Scientific Data, PloS One, and F1000Research
* Stores data in Brain Imaging Data Structure ([BIDS](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/)) format
* Imaging data specifications
 * Longitudinal and multi-session studies with Structural, anatomical imaging data (MPRAGE, T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and many more)
 * Resting state and task-based fMRI data 
 * Physiological (pulse, respiration, etc.) monitoring output acquired during MRI experiments
 * Provides various data streaming processing tools for defacing, motion correction, brain extraction imaging etc for legacy data
