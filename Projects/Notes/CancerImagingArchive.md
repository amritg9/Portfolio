1. Radiomic features - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiomics#:~:text=In%20the%20field%20of%20medicine,appreciated%20by%20the%20naked%20eye.
radiomics is a method that extracts a large number of features from medical images using data-characterisation algorithms. These features, termed radiomic features, have the potential to uncover tumoral patterns and characteristics that fail to be appreciated by the naked eye.
