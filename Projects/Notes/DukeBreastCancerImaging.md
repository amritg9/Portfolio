  - DCE-MRI has been established as a method to quantitatively evaluate tumor biology in terms of microcirculation and tumor response following therapy in vivo. DCE-MRI is performed by using the updated fast imaging sequences that are repeatedly applied over the entire coverage of tumor volume during the intravenous injection of a contrast agent
