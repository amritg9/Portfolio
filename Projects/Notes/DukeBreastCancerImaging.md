  - DCE-MRI has been established as a method to quantitatively evaluate tumor biology in terms of microcirculation and tumor response following therapy in vivo. DCE-MRI is performed by using the updated fast imaging sequences that are repeatedly applied over the entire coverage of tumor volume during the intravenous injection of a contrast agent. It consists of the rapid serial acquisition of MRI images during the injection of a contrast agent (CA; most often a gadolinium chelate). The CA acts by shortening the proton relaxation times of target tissues, which results in a change in the MR signal during data acquisition. After appropriate conversion to concentration, CA uptake curves are analyzed using either compartmental modeling or non-model based approaches to infer the extent and properties of tissue.
