#### Competitive Singing
##### 2016 - Present
An activity that I'm passionate about is singing. I am a 2022 Texas All-State Choir singer, and have been a Texas All-Region Choir singer every year from 7th grade to 11th grade.  At the school and district level, I have received numerous awards for Solo & Ensemble, including Superior ratings and Outstanding Musician awards. I'm a section leader in my school choir, and thoroughly enjoy singing everyday. 
#### Drama Performer at Bengali Association of DFW 
##### 2009 - 2019 
Although I was born and raised here, my roots are in Kolkata, India. I've always wanted to connect with my roots and rich heritage, and so I grew up experiencing literature from many great icons of authorship. 
[Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/1913/tagore/biographical/) is the author who inspired me most to continue learning more about my culture & language. Over the course of 10 years, I've participated in over 20  [traditional Bengali performances](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeXsgQPFrM5wAsCDLslhMNHl_rZv4z9xv), taking part in plays, poems, and songs. 
#### Speech and Debate 
##### 2017 - 2019
As a Lincoln-Douglas debate performer, I participated in various competitive debate programs through DFW Speech and debate and also trained from a LD debate summer camp with Mean Green comet institute at University of Texas at Dallas (UTD). I also represented my school at an inter-IB speech and debate tournament hosted at Trinity IB high school, Euless TX.
